# ENES100_WaterGroup_2019
This repository was created to work on Arduino code for the class ENES100: Introduction to Engineering Design. Within this class, 
I worked on the water subteam. Our mission was to create an Over-Sand Vehicle (OSV) capable of autonomously navigating obstacles,
collecting a water sample, and testing this sample for salt and pollution content.

## WiFi_Communcation
This code tests the WiFi communication module necessary for our OSV's navigation system to function. If the module is operating correctly,
the code will transmit our OSV's coordinates to the class' vision system monitor.
